My Customer Churn analysis and Prediction. 
- I got this dataset from *Kaggle*
- Pretty clean but highly imbalanced
- I explored it using *Snowflake Datawarehoousing*: **EDA file: https://app.snowflake.com/gwxhrxs/nn32360/w3S9rdX1ySLy#query**
- Feature engineered in py notebooks
- Created model with an **86%** accuracy and impressive recall percentages which is the goal.
- I used **XG Boost model** perfect for handling the imbalance, also applied *SMOTE*
- I created a word cloud for churn reason to inform nest steps and would hopfully create a steamlit dashboard next
